Here are some common scenarios that can trigger a “Maximum update depth exceeded” error, along with suggestions for how to fix or avoid them:

---

## 1. An Effect That Depends On a Setter

If you have a useEffect that depends on state variables or store setters, and the effect itself updates that same state again, it can create an infinite loop. For example:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Some fetch or logic here
  setState(...); // triggers another render
}, [state]) // depends on state, so the effect runs again
```

• Fix: Make sure your effect’s dependency array doesn’t include the setter you’re calling, or ensure the effect only runs once or when it truly needs to re-run. Consider moving some logic outside of the effect or using conditionals to prevent repeated state calls.

---

## 2. A Subscription That Re-Sets State on Each Render

If a real-time subscription or event listener calls setState every time it receives a callback (even when nothing changes), you may cause repeated re-renders. For example:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = supabase
    .channel('some-channel')
    .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', table: 'conversations' }, (payload) => {
      // setConversations is called here
      setConversations(...);
    })
    .subscribe();

  return () => {
    supabase.removeChannel(subscription);
  };
}, [setConversations]);
```

If each subscription callback re-triggers the same data update (or sets the same value repeatedly), React will re-render and immediately receive the same subscription event, causing a loop.

• Fix: Add a check to avoid updating state if the data hasn’t changed:  
  - Compare the old conversation list with the new one.  
  - Update only if the newly fetched or received data is different.

---

## 3. Passing State Up and Down Recursively

Sometimes you can accidentally create a cycle if Component A updates something in Component B (via props or a callback), and then B updates a parent store that triggers a re-render of A, repeating indefinitely. Check:

• When you call onChannelSelect → does it set the current conversation in a global store → does that store update re-run code that calls onChannelSelect again?  
• If you’re pushing to a route (e.g. router.push('/somePath')) and that route re-imports the same component with the same effect, you might get a loop.

• Fix: Ensure that selecting a channel only sets the conversation once. If you also trigger a fetch (e.g. “fetch user and conversations” again) from multiple places, coordinate it so you’re not re-fetching/re-setting in a cycle. Sometimes it helps to centralize data fetching to a single effect or custom hook that’s only mounted once.

---

## 4. Message Grouping or Array Loops That Keep Updating

In code that groups messages or iterates over them, look for a setState inside a .forEach or .map that might fire on every pass, causing repeated updates. For example, in the “MessageList” component:

```typescript
const messageGroups = useMemo(() => {
  const groups: MessageGroup[] = [];
  // forEach that calls setState somewhere?
  messages.forEach((m) => {
    // If there's a setMessages or setState call here, that would be a problem
  });
  return groups;
}, [messages]);
```

• Fix: Don’t mutate state during the render phase. If you need to transform messages, do so without calling setState within that loop. The typical React pattern would be:  
  - Transform the data in a useMemo (no setState calls).  
  - Render that data directly.  

---

## 5. Repetitive Fetch Calls

If you have a useEffect that triggers a fetch, and then the fetch sets the store in a way that triggers that same useEffect again, you’ll get stuck in a loop. Check for:

• Re-fetching inside an effect that runs whenever the store changes.  
• The store change re-renders, which re-calls the effect, which sets the store, etc.

• Fix: Carefully set up your dependency array so you only fetch once or only fetch when absolutely necessary. If your effect references store or props, you might need a condition like:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!fetchedAlready) {
    fetchData();
    setFetchedAlready(true);
  }
}, [/* no direct reference to the store or minimal dependencies */]);
```

---

## 6. Debug Tips

• Temporarily add console.logs in your subscription callbacks or effects to see how often they’re firing.  
• Check that your data is actually changing before calling setState / setConversations / setCurrentConversation.  
• Look for code that might be toggling between two states (A → B → A → B) or re-triggering a fetch repeatedly.

---

## Conclusion

In many real-time or subscription-driven apps, the infinite loop often happens because each incoming update triggers the same callback, which triggers a re-render and re-subscription to the same events. Carefully compare data before updating state, or manage your dependency arrays in useEffect so they don’t cause repetitive fetching.

If you narrow down which piece of code is calling setState in a loop, you’ll typically fix the error by:  
• Adding conditions to ensure the new state is actually new/different.  
• Adjusting your effects to run only once or only when required.  
• Preventing cyclical logic between parent/child components.

Good luck hunting down the specific cause in your repo. Feel free to share any suspicious code blocks (minus line numbers!) if you need more detailed help.
