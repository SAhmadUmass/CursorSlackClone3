# Channel Management Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of channel management features in the ChatGenius application, including channel creation, deletion, and information viewing capabilities.

## Features

### 1. Channel Creation

- Users can create new channels with a name and optional description
- Implementation uses a modal dialog with form validation
- Real-time updates across all connected clients
- Channels are stored in Supabase with creator information

### 2. Channel Deletion

- Only channel creators can delete their channels
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Cascading deletion removes all associated messages
- Access control implemented both in UI and API

### 3. Channel Information

- All users can view channel details
- Shows channel name, description, and creation date
- Accessible through an info icon button
- Non-destructive action available to all users

## Implementation Details

### State Management

```typescript
// Using Zustand for state management
interface ChatStore {
  channels: Channel[]
  currentChannel: Channel | null
  setChannels: (channels: Channel[]) => void
  addChannel: (channel: Channel) => void
  updateChannel: (channel: Channel) => void
  deleteChannel: (channelId: string) => void
}
```

### Real-time Updates

```typescript
// Supabase real-time subscription
const channelSubscription = supabase
  .channel('channels-changes')
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'INSERT',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'channels',
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle new channel
    }
  )
  .on(
    'postgres_changes',
    {
      event: 'DELETE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'channels',
    },
    (payload) => {
      // Handle channel deletion
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

### API Endpoints

#### GET /api/channels

- Fetches all channels with message counts
- Requires authentication
- Returns channels sorted by creation date

#### POST /api/channels

- Creates a new channel
- Requires authentication
- Validates input data
- Returns the created channel

#### DELETE /api/channels?id={channelId}

- Deletes a specific channel
- Requires authentication
- Verifies channel ownership
- Cascading deletion of messages

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE channels (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL
);
```

### Security

#### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Channels policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read channels"
  ON channels FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create channels"
  ON channels FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = created_by);

CREATE POLICY "Channel creators can delete their channels"
  ON channels FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = created_by);
```

#### API Security

- All endpoints require authentication
- Delete operations verify user ownership
- Input validation and sanitization
- Error handling with appropriate status codes

### UI Components

#### ChannelList

- Displays all channels
- Handles channel selection
- Shows action buttons on hover
- Conditionally renders delete button based on ownership

#### ChannelCreateModal

- Form for creating new channels
- Input validation
- Loading states
- Error handling

#### ChannelDeleteDialog

- Confirmation dialog
- Loading states
- Error handling
- Only shown to channel owners

#### ChannelInfoDialog

- Displays channel details
- Accessible to all users
- Shows creation date in user-friendly format

## Best Practices

1. **Access Control**

   - UI elements respect user permissions
   - Server-side validation of all actions
   - RLS policies in database

2. **Real-time Updates**

   - Immediate UI updates
   - Supabase real-time subscriptions
   - Optimistic updates with error handling

3. **Error Handling**

   - Graceful error recovery
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Proper error status codes

4. **User Experience**
   - Loading states
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Hover states for actions
   - Clear feedback for user actions

## Future Improvements

1. Channel Editing

   - Allow channel creators to edit channel details
   - Add more channel metadata

2. Channel Archiving

   - Alternative to deletion
   - Preserve channel history

3. Channel Roles

   - Add moderators
   - Different permission levels

4. Enhanced Metrics
   - Active users count
   - Message activity graphs
   - User engagement metrics

## Testing Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Have two different browser windows/tabs open
2. Sign in with different accounts in each window
3. Ensure you have the development server running (`pnpm dev`)

### Test Cases

1. **Channel Creation**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Click the "Create Channel" button
   2. Enter a channel name (e.g., "test-channel")
   3. Add a description (optional)
   4. Click "Create Channel"

   Expected Results:
   - Channel appears in the list immediately
   - Channel appears in other users' windows (real-time)
   - Channel is selectable and messages can be sent
   ```

2. **Channel Information**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Hover over an active channel
   2. Click the info (i) icon
   3. Verify channel details

   Expected Results:
   - Dialog shows channel name
   - Description is visible (or "No description" if none)
   - Creation date is shown in readable format
   ```

3. **Channel Deletion**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Create a channel with Account A
   2. Switch to Account B and verify delete button is not visible
   3. Return to Account A and hover over the channel
   4. Click the delete (trash) icon
   5. Confirm deletion

   Expected Results:
   - Delete button only visible to channel creator
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Channel disappears after deletion
   - Channel removed from other users' views (real-time)
   - Associated messages are deleted
   ```

4. **Real-time Updates**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Open app in two browsers
   2. Create/delete channels in one window
   3. Observe the other window

   Expected Results:
   - Changes appear immediately in both windows
   - No page refresh required
   - Channel list stays sorted alphabetically
   ```

5. **Error Handling**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Try to create a channel with an empty name
   2. Attempt to delete a channel you don't own (via API)
   3. Create channels with duplicate names

   Expected Results:
   - Empty name prevented with validation
   - Unauthorized deletion blocked with error message
   - Appropriate error messages shown
   ```

6. **Permission Testing**

   ```
   Test Steps:
   1. Create channels with different accounts
   2. Switch between accounts
   3. Verify delete button visibility

   Expected Results:
   - Delete button only visible for owned channels
   - Info button visible for all channels
   - Channel creation available to all users
   ```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Channel Not Appearing**

   - Verify authentication status
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure Supabase real-time is enabled

2. **Delete Button Missing**

   - Confirm you're logged in as channel creator
   - Verify channel ownership in database
   - Check user authentication status

3. **Real-time Updates Not Working**

   - Verify Supabase connection
   - Check subscription setup
   - Confirm WebSocket connection

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Verify RLS policies in Supabase
   - Check user authentication
   - Confirm user roles and permissions

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**

   - Create multiple channels (10+)
   - Verify smooth scrolling
   - Check channel switching performance

2. **Network Testing**
   - Test with slow network connection
   - Verify loading states appear
   - Confirm error handling works

### Security Testing

1. **Authentication**

   - Verify unauthenticated access is blocked
   - Confirm API endpoints require auth
   - Test token expiration handling

2. **Authorization**
   - Verify channel ownership checks
   - Test deletion permissions
   - Confirm RLS policies work

### Accessibility Testing

1. **Keyboard Navigation**

   - Tab through channel list
   - Access info and delete buttons
   - Navigate dialogs with keyboard

2. **Screen Reader**
   - Verify ARIA labels
   - Test dialog announcements
   - Confirm action feedback
