# ChatGenius: Modern Workplace Communication

# Background and Context

Chat apps, such as Slack, are a foundational element of the modern workplace. If you work remotely, they _are_ the workplace - and even if you work in-person, chat apps enable asynchronous collaboration and integration with other common tools.

### Submission Guidelines

At the end of each week you'll be required to submit the following to the GauntletAI Platform:

1. A link to the code of the project in Github
2. A 5 minute walkthrough of you showing the world what you've built (and where relevant, how you've built it). The more impressive this is the better.
3. The link to you sharing this project on X, and interacting with any feedback.
